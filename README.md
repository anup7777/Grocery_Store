This is a simple project entitled as "Grocery Store System", which is a system created mainly with the motive to provide  an online interface to the grocery stores for 
their easy and smooth operation through online. This is a group project made by the group "The Admirals", which includes 5 group members. This project is made by using 
python programming language for the frontend part and using MYSQL for the backend part. Also Agile sprint methodology has been used for this project. Developing a system 
was not that easy but, the hardwork of each and every team member and co-ordination of team members made it possible to develop  this project. There are three interfaces
in this system, one is for the admin, another for the users and the last one for the staff. Admin has the solepower to either confirm or delete the registration request 
of customers,staff and the products availabe. The customers have to first get registerd into the system by getting the admin's approval then only the customer can  get 
logged into the system. Once a customer is logged in,  they can purchase the goods and also can  update their credentials. The staff also has to get registered in system 
with admin confirmation and then login into system. After logging in, staff can generate bill of a customer by simply entering the name and number of customer and can also
update his/her credentials. This is the summarized functionality of this system. The following are the screenshoots of the windows of this system :
